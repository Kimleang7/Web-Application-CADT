                "Bringing good food into your everyday. That's our mission.
                That means we don't just deliver we bring it, always going the extra mile to make your experience memorable.

                And it means this is delicious food you can enjoy everyday: from vibrant salads for healthy office lunches, to indulgent family-sized pizzas, to fresh sushi
                for a romantic night in. Whatever you crave, we can help."

                in their mission statement. As consumers, we like to patronize businesses that have values we believe in.
